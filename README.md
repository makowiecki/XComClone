# XComClone 

Simple game based on [UFO XCom](https://youtu.be/PXVPGM5jy0g) created in Unreal Engine 4

- Turn based game for 2 players.
- Each player have 4 units.
- Every unit can have some weapon (pistol, sniper, shotgun, flame thrower etc.) and explosives(granade or mine).
- Units moves on tile map.

Unfortunately graphics are rather poor, but gameplay mechanics are what matters in this project.  
Programmed in only 3 weeks so codebase is not as good as I want it to be.
